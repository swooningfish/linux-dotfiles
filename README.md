## Quick summary of config files:

* Login shell (-l/--login) reads /etc/profile first, and then the first it finds of: ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile.
* Interactive but non-login shell (-i) reads /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, in that order (unless the --rcfile option is used and tells it to look elsewhere).
* Non-interactive shells, e.g. started from within another program without using the -l or -i flags, reads the file specified in the BASH_ENV environment variable.
* When run as sh as a login shell, it will read /etc/profile and ~/.profile, in that order.
* When run as sh as an interactive non-login, it reads the file specified in ENV.
